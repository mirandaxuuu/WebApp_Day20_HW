socket.io chatroom

user guide:
npm init
install express
install socket.io
install socket.io-file
run index.js file
check localhost:3000 to see the app page
files uploaded to chatroom can be found in your "data" folder

current problem:
I spent eight hours trying to make images appear in the chat box, but it wouldn't work... When the user uploads an image, a copy of the image is successfully created in the "data" folder, but I couldn't get it shown in the chat box on my app page.
